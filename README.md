There going to be a few Java project that i want to create, some easy some hard.

1. Rock Paper Scissors. Pretty easy project with just usage of scanner and sout.

2. Digital clock. Was made using Swing, then i decided to do something harder and tried javaFX.

3. Music player. Pretty hard project i`d say. Made with use of javaFX.
